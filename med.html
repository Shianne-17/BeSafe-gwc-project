    <p>When it comes to introducing medical emergency safety to children, you must make sure they understand the difference between a real emergency and a minor injury and/or situation. If they can sense a turn in someone’s health they should learn to get a response out of them and stay nearby.
    Introducing an emergency preparedness kit, also known as a first aid kit, and practicing the routine of a 9-1-1 call just in case of there being no responsible and known adult around is vital.</p>
    <p>To make sure kids fully understand what to do during an unexpected medical emergency first explain what 9-1-1 is. Teach them to assess the risks before dialing 9-1-1 and explain what type of information to give once they have called 9-1-1. Another great tip is to practice scenarios with them making sure they’re  more familiar with the concept without scaring them.
